[Role] 作为民航安全分析师，请从事故报告中提取结构化知识，使用航空领域专业术语
[Task] 将以下{报告名称}的{第几章节}中的知识转换为rdf五元组，按照发生时间顺序排序，严格按以下规则从报告中抽取强化五元组，优先基于证据链（如物理证据 > 证词 > 分析结论），请你严格按照报告的叙述给出五元组。
[Format] 严格使用JSON,值为英文，格式如下：
{
	“number”：””,
 	"tuple": {"subject":"", "predicate":"", "object":"", "event":"", "time":""}
}
[[格式中个字段的概述]]
Number字段表示五元组的编号，如第一个五元组值为1，tuple为五元组，其中Subject字段表示事件主体（entity），predicate字段表示抽象后的动作（relationship），object字段表示事件宾语（entity），event字段表示事件的准确简述，time字段字段为相对时间，方便构建时间线。
[[格式中个字段具体要求]]
1、time字段将某一个知识发生的时间使用相对时间代替，严格使用我定义的相对时间：T-1 = pre-takeoff preparations、T0 = takeoff、T1 = cruising phase、T2 = accident trigger、T3 = accident occurrence、T4 = accident rescue、T5 = post-accident investigation、T6 = accident outcome analysis、T7= recommendations,
实际含义是时间段，如T-1表示是pre-takeoff preparations到takeoff这个时间段。
2、常见通用entity如下，具体根据报告中原文表述写：
	Pre-flight preparations, takeoff, cruise phase, accident trigger, accident occurrence, accident rescue, post-accident investigation, accident outcome analysis, recommendations, pilot (PF（Pilot Flying）/PM（Pilot Monitoring)）, maintenance department, ground controller, aircraft, takeoff clearance, takeoff controller, weather conditions, aircraft status, accident, observer, cabin crew, passengers, other facilities, fire department, investigation department, aircraft wreckage, accident analysts, accident root cause, Federal Aviation Administration, aircraft manufacturer, etc.
3、常见的通用relationship：
	Check status, time-related, engine start, control flight status, manage flight status, control-related, control flight, monitor flight status, direct cause, observation, cause of accident, involvement, conclusion, recommendation for development, safety recommendation, amendment to regulations, report, control, set parameters, adjustment, physical condition, feedback, issue warning, loss of control, damage, requirement, notification, collision, impact, crash, extinguishing fire, investigating the scene, investigating casualties, analysis, investigation, analysts, analyzing data, assessing hazards, analyzing risks.
4、predicate字段，如飞行员-操控-飞机操控可以包含多种动作，调整飞行高度，改变飞行高度，放出起落架或更改飞行速度等等由此可看操控属于predicate，而后续的具体操作属于event（具体事件）。飞行过程中包括多种关系，比如PF - PM, Pilot – Aircraft、Aircraft System - Pilot (Warning or Prompt)、Pilot – Tower、Fire Department – Casualties、Investigators - Aircraft Records、Airline – Recommendations等等
5、重要：值不用首字母大写，全部小写(如Airline – Recommendations，改为
airline – recommendations)，对于特殊字符可以大写（如PF，PM等）
[[特别注意]]
1、在每一个相对时间（T-1到T6）之前加上这个相对时间和实体产生关系的五元组，原因五元组导入neo4j后每一个时间是一个独立的子图，添加下面五元组会让这些离散的图变为一个大图，关系的内容根据报告写，event为空值，time为对应的相对时间。
[Example]
得出的五元组：
Pilot,physical condition,history of gout,use of cyclobenzaprine,T-1
Maintenance department,inspection status,aircraft,engine and control systems with no abnormal records,T-1
Ground controller,feedback,pilot,unable to hear radio sounds clearly,T-1
Ground controller,feedback,pilot,now much better,T-1
Pilot,adjustment,aircraft,adjusting radio equipment,T-1
添加以下五元组：
Pre-takeoff preparation,inspection status,pilot,,T-1
（解释：【Pilot,physical condition,history of gout,use of cyclobenzaprine,T-1】这个五元组在T-1的时间（Pre-takeoff preparation）和自己的本来的subject（Pilot）有关系为inspection status，）
Pre-takeoff preparation,inspection status,maintenance department,,T-1
（解释：【Maintenance department,inspection status,aircraft,engine and control systems with no abnormal records,T-1】这个五元组在T-1的时间（新五元组的subject）和自己的本来的subject（Maintenance department）有关系为inspection status，关系的内容自根据报告写）
Pre-takeoff preparation,inspection status,ground controller,,T-1
（解释：【Ground controller,feedback,pilot,unable to hear radio sounds clearly,T-1】这个五元组在T-1的时间（新五元组的subject）和自己的本来的subject（Ground controller）有关系为inspection status，关系的内容自根据报告写）
2、[key point]一定要合并实体：
对于一些实体可以合并，这样可以减少实体个数，将一些细分的节点范围扩大。
[example]
1、Door 13L和Door 14A可以合并为aircrafts，如果是有关事故的关键因素可以不用合并，比如是因为飞机发动机失效导致的事故，那么发动机就不能扩大到飞机，但是如果是发动机左和发动机右，都可合并为发动机
2、飞行员操作操作杆和飞行员操作仪表盘，实体有飞行员和操纵杆和仪表盘，但是操纵杆都是和仪表盘飞机上的，所以总结成两个实体是飞行员和仪表盘
3、对于aircraft airspeed或者altitude等，都可以合并为aircraft state
[Examples]
  输入文本：" 1. Factual Information
On March 4, 2008, about 1515 central standard time,1 a Cessna 500, N113SH, registered to Southwest Orthopedic & Sports Medicine Clinic PC of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, entered a steep descent and crashed about 2 minutes after takeoff from Wiley Post Airport (PWA) in Oklahoma City. None of the entities associated with the flight claimed to be its operator.2 The pilot, the second pilot,3 and the three passengers were killed, and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces and postcrash fire. The flight was operated under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 with an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan filed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed. The flight originated from the ramp of Interstate Helicopters (a 14 CFR Part 135 on-demand helicopter operator at PWA) and was en route to Mankato Regional Airport (MKT), Mankato, Minnesota, carrying company executives who worked for United Engines and United Holdings, LLC.4  
	The flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 17L at 1512:35, and the flight crew’s departure clearance was to turn right to a heading of 200° and maintain an initial altitude of 3,000 feet above mean sea level (msl).5 The flight departed, and, at 1514:12, the flight crew checked in with the Oklahoma City departure controller, reporting that the flight was climbing out of 2,000 feet for 3,000 feet.6 About 28 seconds later, the flight crew checked in again, reporting that the flight was level at 3,000 feet. The departure controller acknowledged, advised that the flight was in radar contact, and issued instructions to turn the airplane right to a heading of 290° and climb to 15,000 feet. There was no response from the flight crew. At 1515:03, an unknown person reported on the PWA local control frequency, “I just saw an airplane crash and explode.” 
2. Analysis
Review of the accident airplane’s available flight and maintenance logs revealed numerous omissions and errors. Although the maintenance records for the accident airplane were not kept in accordance with 14 CFR 91.417, no maintenance discrepancies were identified to be related to the cause of the accident. The airplane was severely fragmented and fire damaged due to the impact and postcrash fire, and wreckage debris was scattered over an area about 300 feet long and 200 feet wide. The accident was not survivable for the airplane occupants because they were subjected to impact forces that exceeded the limits of human tolerance. The following analysis describes the accident flight sequence, engine and airframe certification standards for bird strikes, airport wildlife hazard assessment and mitigation requirements, pilot operational strategies to help minimize aircraft damage sustained in the event of a bird strike, and the importance of compiling the most complete bird-strike database possible.63 Further, although the accident pilot was trained and qualified to fly the accident airplane in a noncommercial capacity, several issues related to the identity of the operator and the manner in which the flight was conducted suggest that the flight was a noncompliant commercial charter; these issues are discussed in detail in Section 2.4. FAA oversight, CVR functionality, and pilot medical issues are also discussed.
3. Conclusions:
1. Although the maintenance records for the accident airplane were not kept in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations 91.417, no maintenance discrepancies were identified to be related to the cause of the accident. 
2. The accident was not survivable for the airplane occupants because they were subjected to impact forces that exceeded the limits of human tolerance. 
3. The airplane’s departure from controlled flight likely resulted from wing structure damage sustained during an in-flight collision with a flock of American white pelicans, which far exceeded the airframe’s design certification limit. 
4. The current airframe certification standards for bird strikes are insufficient because they are not based on bird-strike risks to aircraft derived from analysis of current bird-strike and bird-population data and trends and because they allow for lower levels of bird-strike protection for some structures on the same airplane. 
5. The accident airplane’s left engine was capable of producing sufficient thrust for the airplane to continue to fly with the right engine inoperative, and the loss of power in one engine would not alone result in a loss of control of the airplane. 
4. Recommendations
Revise the bird-strike certification requirements for 14 Code of Federal 
      Regulations Part 25 airplanes so that protection from in-flight impact with birds is consistent across all airframe structures. Consider the most current military and civilian bird-strike database information and trends in bird populations in drafting this revision. (A-09-72) 
Verify that all federally obligated general aviation airports that are located near woodlands, water, wetlands, or other wildlife attractants are complying with the requirements to perform wildlife hazard assessments as specified in Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 150/5200-33B, Hazardous Wildlife Attractants On or Near Airports. (A-09-73)
Executive Summary:
On March 4, 2008, about 1515 central standard time, a Cessna 500, N113SH, registered to Southwest Orthopedic & Sports Medicine Clinic PC of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, entered a steep descent and crashed about 2 minutes after takeoff from Wiley Post Airport (PWA) in Oklahoma City. None of the entities associated with the flight claimed to be its operator. The pilot, the second pilot, and the three passengers were killed, and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces and postcrash fire. The flight was operated under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 with an instrument flight rules flight plan filed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed. The flight originated from the ramp of Interstate Helicopters (a 14 CFR Part 135 on-demand helicopter operator at PWA) and was en route to Mankato Regional Airport, Mankato, Minnesota, carrying company executives who worked for United Engines and United Holdings, LLC. 
      The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was airplane wing-structure damage sustained during impact with one or more large birds (American white pelicans), which resulted in a loss of control of the airplane. 
      The safety issues discussed in this report focus on airframe certification standards for bird strikes, inadequate Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enforcement of wildlife hazard assessment requirements for airports located near wildlife attractants, the lack of published information regarding aircraft operational strategies for pilots to minimize bird-strike damage to aircraft, and inadequate FAA detection of and intervention in improper charter operations. Safety recommendations concerning these issues are addressed to the FAA."
